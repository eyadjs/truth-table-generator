# Truth Table Generator
## A terminal application built using Python 3.10 that prompts the user for a logical propositional statement and outputs the corresponding truth table.

* The logical operations supported include negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication, and bi-implication.


### When the user runs `main.py`, they are prompted with the following:

         Enter your logical statement:
        
        
### If they enter `not p and q` for example, the following truth table is reproduced:

         p | q    ¬ p ∧ q 
         -------  ---------
         T | T    F
         T | F    F
         F | T    T
         F | F    F
